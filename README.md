# five38-riddler

## Introduction

This repository contains code-based solutions to weekly "The Riddler" puzzles from 538. Most solutions will be written in Python, though I may also write some C/C++.

I may skip some weeks due to a busy work schedule, or if the problems are intractable from a computational perspective.
